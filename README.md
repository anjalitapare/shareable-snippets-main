# Pastebin-Lite
<!-- This project was developed and completed by Anjali Tapare as part of a take-home assignment.  -->

Pastebin-Lite is a small, production-ready web application inspired by Pastebin.  
It allows users to create a text paste, generate a shareable link, and view the paste via that link.

This project is built as part of a **take-home assignment** and is designed to be evaluated primarily through **automated tests** against a deployed application.

The application is developed using **Node.js and Next.js**, with a persistent storage layer to ensure reliability in serverless environments.  
Deployment on **Vercel** is recommended and fully supported.

Key features include:
- Creating and sharing text pastes
- Viewing pastes via unique URLs
- Optional time-based expiry (TTL)
- Optional view-count limits
- Serverless-safe persistent storage
